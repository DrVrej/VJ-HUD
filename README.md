# VJ HUD
**This is an extension for VJ Base, it enables the HUD features for users.**

**About**: This addon was originally made in 2013, but it was never released. Over the years I worked on it couple times a year, but at this point due to all the people requesting to upload the addon, I have decided to release the addon publicly. If you have any suggestions for the addon, let me know!
